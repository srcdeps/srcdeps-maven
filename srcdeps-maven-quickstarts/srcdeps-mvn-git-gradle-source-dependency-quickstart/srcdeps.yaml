# `repositories` - a map of source repositories to checkout and build from
#
# Required, no default
# Since 1.0
repositories:

  # the `id` of the source repository, typically the `groupId` of its artifacts,
  # or any other string unique at this level of the yaml file.
  org.srcdeps.test.gradle:

    # `includes` - select which dependency artifacts should be built from this source repository.
    #
    # An include is a pattern to match dependency GAVs (triples of groupId, artifactId and version) against. An include
    # has three colon delimited subpatterns, one for each of groupId, artifactId and version. The subpatterns for
    # artifactId and version can be omitted. The subpatterns may contain the wildcard * that stands for a number
    # of characters or an empty string.
    #
    # = examples of includes:
    #
    # `org.my-group`             an equivalent of `org.my-group:*:*`. It will match any version of any artifact
    #                            having groupId `org.my-group`.
    #
    # `org.my-group*`            an equivalent of `org.my-group*:*:*`. It will match any version of any artifact
    #                            whose groupId starts with `org.my-group` - i.e. it will match all of `org.my-group`,
    #                            `org.my-group.api`, `org.my-group.impl`, etc.
    #
    # `org.my-group:my-artifact` an equivalent of `org.my-group:my-artifact:*`. It will match any version of all such
    #                            artifacts that have groupId `org.my-group` and artifactId `my-artifact`
    #
    # `org.my-group:my-artifact:1.2.3` will match just the version 1.2.3 of artifacts `org.my-group:my-artifact`.
    #
    # At least one include is required
    # Since 2.2
    #
    # Note that `includes` has the same meaning as `includes` that existed since 1.0. `includes` is still kept as an
    # alias for `includes`.
    #
    # Note that in configModelVersion: 1.0, includes consisted only of groupId literals to perform exact string match
    # with the `groupId` of the dependency. Because the subpatterns for artifactId and version can be omitted since 1.1
    # the 1.1 includes are backward compatible with 1.0 includes.
    #
    includes:
    - org.srcdeps.test.gradle # This SCM repository entry will be used for building artifacts
                                   # with groupId org.srcdeps.test.gradle (unless the given artifact is excluded
                                   # by `excludes`)

    # `urls` - a list of URLs to checkout the sources of the given dependency. If you list multiple SCM
    # repositories here then only the first successful checkout will count.
    #
    # At least one URL is required
    # Since 1.0
