= `srcdeps` for Maven Configuration Guide

The behavior of `srcdeps` is controlled through two configuration files:

<<extensions-xml>> - make Maven aware of `srcdeps` +
<<srcdeps-yaml>> - the main srcdeps configuration file

Note that both files can be initialized by running our `srcdeps-maven-plugin`'s `init` mojo the in the root
directory of your project tree:

[source,shell]
----
mvn org.srcdeps.mvn:srcdeps-maven-plugin:init
----

[[extensions-xml]]
== 1. `.mvn/extensions.xml`

`srcdeps-maven-local-repository` needs to be declared as a Maven Core Extension in `.mvn/extensions.xml`
of the maven project.

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<extensions>
  <extension>
    <groupId>org.l2x6.maven.srcdeps</groupId>
    <artifactId>srcdeps-maven-local-repository</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.0</version><!-- @srcdeps.version@ -->
  </extension>
  <extension>
    <groupId>org.srcdeps.mvn</groupId>
    <artifactId>srcdeps-maven-enforcer</artifactId><!-- to prevent srcdeps in releases -->
    <version>4.0.0</version><!-- @srcdeps.version@ -->
  </extension>
</extensions>
----

[[srcdeps-yaml]]
== 2. `srcdeps.yaml`

A few settings have to be configured in `srcdeps.yaml` file. Especially, the mapping from groupId's of
dependencies to SCM repositories where their sources reside. This is a minimal `srcdeps.yaml` file. Please
refer to link:https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps-core/tree/master/doc/srcdeps.yaml[srcdeps.yaml reference] for more
details.

The `srcdeps.yaml` file has to be located in the root directory of a Maven source tree. Before version 3.1.0 of
`srcdeps-maven` the location was `.mvn/srcdeps.yaml` and it is still supported as a fall back location in case
there is no `srcdeps.yaml` in the root directory.

[source,yaml]
----
configModelVersion: 2.4
repositories:
  org.my-group:
    includes:
    - org.my-group:*:*  # if one of the includes matches the groupId of a -SRC- dependency,
                        # then the following urls will be used to build that dependency
    urls:
    - https://github.com/my-org/my-project.git  # If you list multiple SCM repos here then only
                                                # the first successful checkout will count

== 3. Setting dependency versions

There are two alternative ways how you can define which source repository reference should be used to build your
dependency: in `pom.xml` or in `srcdeps.yaml`.

[[srcdeps-in-pom-xml]]
=== 3.1 In `pom.xml`

Defining source repository refs in `pom.xml` is older and perhaps more straightforward:

[source,yaml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.my-group</groupId>
      <artifactId>my-artifact</artifactId>
      <version>0.0.1-SRC-revision-66ea95d890531f4eaaa5aa04a9b1c69b409dcd0b</version>
    </dependency>
----

The `-SRC-` infix in the version makes `srcdeps-maven-local-repository` detect the dependency as source
dependency. The part after the `-SRC-` infix is supposed to be a dash separated pair of `refType` and `refName`.
`refType` is one of `revision`, `branch` or `tag` and the `refName` is the actual commitId, branch name or
tag name.

Examples:

* `0.0.1-SRC-revision-66ea95d890531f4eaaa5aa04a9b1c69b409dcd0b`
* `1.2.3-SRC-branch-1.2.x`
* `2.0.1-SRC-tag-2.0.1`

The part before `-SRC-` has no significance for `srcdeps`. It also has no significance for Maven. It may be
important for Gradle when resolving version conflicts; Gradle prefers higher versions by default. A practical reason
to keep it there is to have a mnemonic that helps a human reader to set her expectations about the compatibility of
the dependency.

[[srcdeps-in-srcdeps-yaml]]
=== 3.2 in `srcdeps.yaml` (since `srcdeps-maven` 3.3.0)

If you do not want or cannot change the `pom.xml`, you can achieve a similar result by using
`buildVersionPattern` and `buildRef` of `srcdeps.yaml`.

[source,yaml]
----
configModelVersion: 2.4
repositories:
  org.my-group:
    includes:
    - org.my-group:*:*  # if one of the includes matches the groupId of a -SRC- dependency,
                        # then the following urls will be used to build that dependency
    urls:
    - https://github.com/my-org/my-project.git  # If you list multiple SCM repos here then only
                                                # the first successful checkout will count
    buildVersionPattern: .*-SNAPSHOT  # versions matching .*-SNAPSHOT pattern will be built
    buildRef: branch-1.2.x            # using branch 1.2.x from https://github.com/my-org/my-project.git
----

If you combine the above `srcdeps.yaml` with a `pom.xml` like the following

----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.my-group</groupId>
      <artifactId>my-artifact</artifactId>
      <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
----

 `srcdeps` will build the snapshot
of `org.my-group:my-artifact` from the remote branch 1.2.x every time you build the dependent project.
